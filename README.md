- Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Naseeb Panghal, a passionate technologist and a Master's graduate in Computer Applications from MDU University. I take a great interest in solving complex problems and building beautiful, user-friendly web interfaces.

Over the years, I've honed my skills in Frontend Development, and my tech stack includes Angular, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. I believe that the key to a great application is not just about the robust backend, but also an intuitive and responsive frontend.

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects and ideas or contribute to open-source projects. Constantly learning and evolving my skills is something that I believe firmly in. I aim to create impact and value through the fusion of aesthetics and functionality.

Feel free to explore my repositories or get in touch if you're interested in my work. Looking forward to creating awesome digital solutions together!
